title: Railsconf 2011, See You There!
date: 15/05/2011

## Will you be there?

Are you going to be at Railsconf 2011 in Baltimore, MD? Give me a shout if you will. Feel
free to randomly say "hello" to me. It should be pretty easy to
recognize me between the height, and blue forearm tattoo.

Looking forward to hanging out with all of you as usual, and for the
awesome sessions (I mean the hallway track...)

See you soon, heading to LAX now.
