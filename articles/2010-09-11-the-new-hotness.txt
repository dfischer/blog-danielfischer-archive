title: The New Hotness
date: 11/09/2010

Well isn't this schnazy? What do we have here? I updated the main site, [www.danielfischer.com](http://www.danielfischer.com "Daniel Fischer Homepage"). I hope you like it. I felt like I needed a refreshing new look and feel. I haven't had much time to put some polish on my aesthetics in a while.

Some things that I did:

* Implemented new site with HTML5 standards & properly validated.
* Migrated to Heroku.
* Setup [toto](http://github.com/cloudhead/toto) as the blogging engine.
* Experimenting with using DISQUS as commenting platform for blog.
* Created [archive](http://www.danielfischer.com "Archive of danielfischer.com before 9/11/2010") of all old posts previously created on [danielfischer.com](http://www.danielfischer.com). No style information was transferred. I wonder how this will affect SERP's?
