## Magma what?
I just got back from [Magmarails](http://www.magmarails.com) in Mexico. It was an amazing trip. It
was my first time presenting at a conference. Public speaking was a terrible
source of anxiety and fear for me. I'm so happy that I actually overcame
that fear and just did it. I'm extremely happy that it went so well,
even with a curve ball in place; which apparently always happens.
Despite the curve ball, I received applause and a lot of questions. This
was amazing. Both in the fact that it made me more confident about
presenting, and it also validated the problems I am speaking of. Thank
you Magmarails for making me do it.

Magmarails is a special conference. It's amazing not only because it's
in Mexico, but it's amazing because of the hospitality, culture, and
general quality of care. I've never gotten close to so many people in
such a short amount of time at a conference. Every single person was
amazing, and it was great that we could enjoy this not only at bars, but
also in the ocean [boogie boarding](http://vimeo.com/43846798). It was great to have
[@deadprogram](http://twitter.com/deadprogram),
[@geemus](http://twitter.com/geemus),
[@bmizerany](http://twitter.com/bmizerany),
[@tenderlove](http://twtitter.com/tenderlove), and [@drnic](http://twitter.com/drnic) there. It was just as great to have these
amazingly talented people be available to the entire conference for
questions and inspiration. Most conferences don't get that ability
because there's too many people. Magmarails is relatively small compared
to most conferences and I found that to be amazing. It gives more
opportunities to really learn and grow.  

I learned a lot, and I had a lot of fun. It was an amazing time and I
really look forward to next year, and giving another presentation. I
also look forward to spending time with so many wonderful people. Truly
a "life" experience.

## What'd I present about?
In case you're curious, I was presenting about [Front-End Development](https://speakerdeck.com/u/dfischer/p/what-is-front-end-development) and
the problems associated with it. I'm starting a movement. It's called
[#betterfrontend](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23betterfrontend).

I want to make Front-End Development better. It has two major issues
right now, it's hard to learn, and it's hard to do well. Perhaps I can
explain these issues more in-depth with a blog post, and or you can see
me present. I need to hit up some more conferences now and really shove
this fear out the window. If I don't present in a while I know it will
come back again.

Anyway, I'll leave this post quickly with a nice gif summarizing my
entire experience at #magmarails.
